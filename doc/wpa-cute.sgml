    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>wpaCute is a graphical Qt front end program for interacting
    with wpa_supplicant. It's used to query current status, change
    configuration and request interactive user input.</para>

    <para>It supports (almost) all of the interactive status and
    configuration features of the command line client, wpa_cli. Refer
    to the wpa_cli man page for a comprehensive list of the interactive
    mode features.</para>

    <para>wpaCute is a fork from wpa_gui, shipped with wpa_supplicant
    version 2.6</para>

    <title>Command Arguments</title>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
  <term>-i ifname</term>
  <listitem><para>Specify the interface that is being
  configured. By default, choose the first interface found with
  a control socket in the socket path.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
  <term>-m seconds</term>
  <listitem><para>Set an independent update interval in seconds for the signal
  strength meter.</para>
  <para>This value must be a positive integer. Without <option>-m</option> the
  signal meter is only updated at each status update.
  See also <option>-P</option> and the notes about polling and pinging.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
  <term>-N</term>
  <listitem><para>Force not to use QSocketNotifier, use polling instead so it
  implies <option>-P</option>. It's more for testing purposes.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
  <term>-p path</term>
  <listitem><para>Change the path where control sockets should
  be found.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
  <term>-P</term>
  <listitem><para>Enable polling and pinging wpa_supplicant independent to the
  use of QSocketNotifier.</para>
  <para>This may useful when you have more than one wpa_supplicant front end
  running because the wpa_supplicant does not send a message when the configured
  networks are changed, the status changes to Inactive or from
  Scanning/Inactive to Disconnected.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
  <term>-q</term>
  <listitem><para>Run program in the quiet mode - do not display tray
  icon pop-up messages.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
  <term>-t</term>
  <listitem><para>Start program in the system tray only (if the window
  manager supports it). By default the main status window is
  shown.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
  <term>-W</term>
  <listitem><para>Unset setting - Disable network after "WRONG_KEY"</para>
  <para>This a workaround to a wpa_supplicant quirk where he endless tries to
  connect to a wrong configured network. There are cases where it is a good idea,
  but I believe it is mostly annoying due to it's implementation. If I'm wrong,
  use <option>-W</option> to have the original behavior. By default will now a
  network disabled after a "WRONG_KEY" message.

  <refsect1><title>Things Of Interest</title>

  <refsect2><title>Polling And Pinging</title>

  <para>QSocketNotifier is not supported on all systems but used by
  default. On such systems is wpa_supplicant polled and pinged to fetch
  status changes.
  </para>
  <para>The polling is not done in a fixed interval but depends on
  current status and reach from high frequent polling in 1sec, when
  probably changes are on the way, down to 20sec in normal Connected
  mode where only is checked if all looks good.
  </para>
  <para>With the main window visible is polled in 2.5sec.
  When in Inactive or Scanning status is polled in 9sec.
  Will the adapter disconnected is still polled in 20sec.
  In case of an fatal error is polling halted.
  </para>
  </refsect2>

  <refsect2><title>Edit Network</title>

  <para>The window morphs its look to show always only what is needed, or can be
  used, to some selections you made. If you encounter some misbehaviour please
  report.
  </para>
  <para>Entered secrets will not shown again when you edit a network. Only a
  hint that there is a password or key saved. I'm not a friend of that because
  while messing around to get a connect you can't check if you miss typed the
  password or something different is the problem.
  </para>
  <para>When you add, delete or modify a network are these changes only made in
  a temporary manner inside the running wpa_supplicant. They take effect as long
  as the wpa_supplicant is not terminated or triggered to reload its
  configuration. You have to save the changes explicit. This is different from
  the original wpa_gui.
  </para>
  <para>Right now is the behaviour, which data are changed (send to
  wpa_supplicant) not coherend. It depends sometimes if they are visible when
  you "Apply" or not. Your removed data are not everytime forced to remove by
  wpa_supplicant. It's a little messi, sorry. Needs love and reports.
  </para>
  <para>Right now will no data explicit removed when they are not visible. The
  wpa_supplicant documentation describes that you can have a pretty mix of
  possible settings which are all tested when wpa_supplicant tries to connect
  to some accesspoint. I'm not sure if this is really a smart decison.
  </para>
  <para>Long story, short sense: Don't expect to have a "clean" configured
  network block in your config file after you have clicked around to find a
  working setup.
  </para>
  </refsect2>

  <refsect2><title>Peers</title>
  <para>While transforming some code from old-school C/C++ to a more Qt like
  style, I noticed some wpa control request that are not, or in a different way,
  supported by wpa_cli. So you may encounter some disappointments. I haven't
  played much with the peers window.
