wpaCute - A graphical wpa_supplicant front end
================================================
This is a fork from wpa_gui, shipped with wpa_supplicant version 2.6, which
has a couple of issues I have fixed in this new derivative. I did not have tried
to send my patches upstream because of their terms and my paranoia.

I started using wpa_gui when I was looking for a tray icon for my systemd-only
network setup on my new laptop and realized as soon that there was not all
roses. Beginning from wrong/missing icons to the actual wlan status, over
baffling buttons, windows and menus up to a smashed, no longer working
configuration after an save event, with obviously no changes mind you!

First I concentrated on fixing the most annoying issues, but at some point I
started to "fix unbroken things" just because I didn't like how the code looks.
So, sorry experts, if I may have trash some of your super effective tricks and
replaced that with some "bloated" Qt class. However, I think the code not only
looks better now, but works much better too.

Furthermore I add some new stuff where I think it's an improvement but probably
I have introduced some new bugs too which you will find faster than it is dear
to me. For details please read the commit log or just check it out!

I'm an average user and haven't tested much more than to connect to my own WLAN.
No tests of P2P and never mind some expert needs.

I use only Arch Linux but tried my best not to broke the code for other systems.

  - Change, add or remove network profiles
  - Support for many station modes, from outdated insecure up to WPA3
  - Small memory foot print, download ~300k, install ~800k, running ~10M


Requirements
==============
  - Qt-Version >= 5.15


Installation
==============
Packages
----------
Arch Linux has an AUR, search for wpa-cute.


From Source
-------------
  $ cd src
  $ qmake       # Or qmake-qt5 or qmake6 to force some Qt version other than
                # your system default
  $ make        # To enable debug messages run: make -f Makefile.Debug. When you
                # switch between Qt5/6 for testing, add -B to force remake all

Because there is no make install target yet, run on Unices

  # install -Dm755 wpa-cute /usr/bin/wpa-cute
  # install -Dm644 icons/wpa_gui.svg /usr/share/pixmaps/wpa-cute.svg
  # install -Dm644 wpa-cute.desktop /usr/share/applications/wpa-cute.desktop
  # install -Dm644 ../doc/wpa-cute.8 /usr/share/man/man8/wpa-cute.8

Additional is the man page available as HTML and PDF but not yet referenced
by wpaCute itself.

Non Unices user has to do something similar.


Post Install Steps
--------------------
wpaCute itself need no more configuration but you should ensure that your
network interfaces will set up properly and that wpa_supplicant is configured
and running. Consult the man pages of wpa_supplicant and/or your distribution
documentation how to do that.

Ensure you have the rights to manage the interface in question, typically done
by set 'ctrl_interface_group=wheel' in the .conf file.

Just as example, here a setup that was enough on my Arch:

  $ cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp2s0.conf
  ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
  ctrl_interface_group=wheel
  update_config=1

  $ cat /etc/systemd/network/wlp2s0.network
  [Match]
  Name=wlp2s0

  [Network]
  DHCP=ipv4

  # systemctl start systemd-networkd.service
  # systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlp2s0.service
