wpaCute - A graphical wpa_supplicant front end
================================================
This is a fork from wpa_gui, shipped with wpa_supplicant version 2.6, which
has a couple of issues. I did not have tried to send my patches upstream because
of their terms and my paranoia. I'm pretty sure I read a notice back then
(around 2018) that further development and maintenance is officially
discontinued. Unfortunately, I can no longer find that hint today (2024). But
there are only a handful of commits since 2015 and only two of them are halfway
code related.

The most annoying issues are fixed for me in this derivative and some things
changed where I thought it's an improvement. But I'm an average user and haven't
tested much more than to connect to a few WLAN in WPA2/3 Personal mode. It is
quite possible that some other things are not working so well. This is mainly
due to the desolate documentation run around WLAN modes and wpa_supplicant,
which is at best only halfway comprehensible for full professionals. Any advice
is welcome.

I use only Arch Linux but tried my best not to broke the code for other systems.


Last version is 0.8.5, Apr 2024
---------------------------------
  - Add a field to filter SSID in scan results
  - Replace signal strength progress bar with a custom star-meter ★★★☆☆
  - Fix/Add session support, new option -R
  - Fix gone menu in main window and actions in tray icon context menu
  - Add much more info to the tool-tip of the tray icon
  - Fix: Don't show "Keep running..." message when we quit immediately after
    a normal start
  - Add more info to man page, switch man-page source from .sgml to .ronn
  - Some minor changes

I tend to remove some functions in future versions. So if you use something
other than WPA2/3 Personal, or Linux please let me know! What I have in mind is
  - WEP stuff, both offers and these key box
  - Old WPA (not 2/3) both offers
  - Some fields like for pairwise
  - Peers window

Older release notes can you find below. For details see the commit log.


Features
==========
  - Runs in the background to display the Wi-Fi status icon in the system tray
  - Scan for networks and connect to them via WPS or enter the data manually
  - Change, add or remove network profiles
  - Support for many station modes, from outdated insecure up to WPA3
  - Small memory foot print, download ~350k, install ~1M, running ~30M


Requirements
==============
  - Qt-Version >= 5.15


Installation
==============
Packages
----------
Arch Linux has an AUR, search for wpa-cute.


From Source
-------------
  $ cd src
  $ qmake       # Or qmake-qt5 or qmake6 to force some Qt version other than
                # your system default
  $ make        # To enable debug messages run: make -f Makefile.Debug. When you
                # switch between Qt5/6 for testing, add -B to force remake all

Because there is no make install target yet, run on Unices

  # install -Dm755 wpa-cute /usr/bin/wpa-cute
  # install -Dm644 icons/wpa_gui.svg /usr/share/pixmaps/wpa-cute.svg
  # install -Dm644 wpa-cute.desktop /usr/share/applications/wpa-cute.desktop
  # install -Dm644 ../doc/wpa-cute.8 /usr/share/man/man8/wpa-cute.8

Non Unices user has to do something similar.

Additional can the man page generated as HTML out of the .ronn file. To
do so run:

  $ cd ../doc
  $ make html # or man or all

The "native" man page should already be up to date, as assumed above. To create
the files is ronn needed. On my Arch was ruby-ronn-ng available which pull a
bunch of dependencies but cost only 30,65 MiB in total.


Post Install Steps
--------------------
wpaCute itself need no more configuration but you should ensure that your
network interfaces will set up properly and that wpa_supplicant is configured
and running. Consult the man pages of wpa_supplicant and/or your distribution
documentation how to do that.

Ensure you have the rights to manage the interface in question, typically done
by set 'ctrl_interface_group=wheel' in the .conf file.

Just as example, here a setup that was enough on my Arch:

  $ cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp2s0.conf
  ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
  ctrl_interface_group=wheel
  update_config=1

  $ cat /etc/systemd/network/wlp2s0.network
  [Match]
  Name=wlp2s0

  [Network]
  DHCP=ipv4

  # systemctl start systemd-networkd.service
  # systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlp2s0.service
