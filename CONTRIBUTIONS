1.0 release
-------------
- Add a nice progressbar (or similar) to wpsdialog when WPS is running and the
  window visible
- Avoid the repeating, ever the same messages in the Events tab when running
  WPS or Scanning. Could be done in logHint
- Save/Restore program state between runs independent to some session manager
- Add/Enable Help->Index/Contents to view at least the man page
- Remove the license from about.cpp and read them out of the (installed) file
- Add a window/tab to set/change all kind of wpa_supplicant variables that can
  be configured in the .config file. A list is fetch able with
    ctrlRequest"DUMP", buf, len) when len is long enough.
- Do some checks with tools like valgrind if there are ugly mistakes


General Jobs
--------------
- An own application icon would be nice !!!
- Save/Restore window position between hide()/show(). It seams to be a kwin
  issue because pos() is in hide()/show() the same. So I think it is moved
  afterwards by kwin to the center of the screen
- Investigate and fix (if needed) handling of SSIDs with includet quotes. The
  supplicant seems to support it but not our networkconfig
- Add a status bar to Edit Network window. Surprisingly tricky to add one to a
  QDialog, QtDesigner offers no QStatusBar but did not grumble when you and one
  direct to the ui file. But when double click it in Designer it disappears
  and it couldn't bring back with Ctrl-Z. How ever, once added this way it still
  did not work. Need more tricks, hook into some event

  http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/10593-QDialog-StatusBar
- Add an info/error/warning icon to to the statusHint when showing not
  the status. Add the tray icon when showing the status
- Add some icons to the Envents log entries at least when error/warning
- Change debug to some more smart solution. These #define doesn't accept
  QFooBarClass and it can't combinet with qDebug() << QFooBarClass
- Would be nice to have ONE place for version/release date that will include to
  the source and documentation at build time
- Add a Changelog tab to the about dialog, but ensure to fill it out of some
  shipped CHANGELOG file
- Regarding -W: The supplicant delivers in the WRONG_KEY message infos about
  the next try and how often was tried, e.g. "auth_failures=8" "duration=90",
  perhaps -W could take an optional parm try-max and the duration could used to
  hint the user when is next tried to connect. Furthermore could -W only disable
  a network with set bssid, but not with 'any'
- Enhance the man page with more info, but don't explain each button
- Icons for missing or not good looking wpa states, on breeze theme:
  - is the question mark too small when scanning
  - there is no different icon for inactive and disconnected.
  - Not running supplicant is on breeze now some undefined "error" which looks
    not so bad but it could be nicer/meaning fuller


Uncertainly
-------------
- What the big deal of update_config=0? It is surprisingly possible to overwrite
  the configuration when you unset this setting. But you can't save
  'update_config=0' to the config file. Currently is 'update_config=0' respected
  but make this sense?
- Offer enable/disable the adapter by rfkill? But rfkill seams to be Linux
  specific, so there has to be a couple of tests/alternatives
- Investigate the use of blacklist command, also regarding -W switch. I played
  around but couldn't notice some useful effect
- See wpa_cli help wps_er_ / wps_nfc, important?


Contributions to wpaCute
==========================

Send patches in any way you like with any identity you prefer. I use only Linux
with KDE/Plasma and will not test code for other systems. But I have kept the
code as it was and would accept patches for what ever system as long as it not
break my box.

  - Try to follow the existent look of the code, which not mean to be extra
    varied
  - I have tried to use "indent with tabs, align with spaces". There is a
    .kateconfig file in the source root. Should you use an other editor and that
    support .editorconfig feel free to add such file and make a PR. These style
    is not well supported and rarely used but I like to do it here
  - Don't use under_scores, use camelCase
  - Place *& left to the type not right to the variable in declarations
  - Place the open brace { of a function not on an own line but keep a blank
    line to the function body
  - Old code forces a line length of 80 char, but I'm not a fan of that, so feel
    free but do not overdo it. 100 is fine, 110 may, at 120 I say ouch!
  - Try to use only Qt stuff in new code and avoid the standard library
  - Don't clutter the code with your copyright hints as long as you not
    introduce some new class. If so, add my hint at the top like in peers.h. We
    can change the about window and add there a contributor tab with your name
    and done work if you like
  - Hint: To build the various doc files out of the wpa-cute.sgml file I needed
    on my Arch the packages perl-sgmls, docbook-sgml and docbook-utils
